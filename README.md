React Custom Hook

In this assignment, I created a custom hook called useFetch.

The purpose of this hook is to fetch data from an API and manage:
- loading state
- error state
- data state

I used:
- useState
- useEffect

The Products component uses this hook to fetch product data from the API and display it.

This helped me understand how custom hooks can be reused in different components.
